## Schedule for the next meetup (July 26th)
1. `({ what, why, how } = Destructuring);`

    You've seen it around, but can you solve the lispiest destructuring statements?  We'll be diving deep on the whys and wherefores of Javascript Destructuring.

2. What's New ES2017 (ES8)?

    Just last month ES2017 was released (well, finalized).  This talk will cover what's been added to the language, how/when/where to use each feature.

## What
A meetup where we discuss all things javascript, but mainly focusing on React and associated members of the React ecosystem.  We're very conversational in format, and always have food and drinks available for attendees!

## When
We meet on the last Wednesday of every month at 6pm.  It's been on Wendesdays since before Rick and Morty season 3 was announced to be on Wednesdays, so we may adjust accordingly depending on what the airtime looks like.

## Where
#### Local
Benzinga Global Headquarters
1 Campus Martius #200, Detroit, MI 48226
#### Remote
[YouTube Live](https://youtube.com/channel/UC5nH9vHH4512vDhxnvk3kPA/live)

## Why
Detroit is growing fast, that much is for sure.  We started this meetup to address an equally growing growing need for resource groups and engineer networks aimed at frontend technologies (and where better to start than with React).

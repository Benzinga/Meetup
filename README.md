## Schedule for the next meetup (July 26th)
1. Error Boundaries in React 16

    Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.  This is a huge feature for complex applications that prevents a nested sub component from taking down your whole app!  If you are developing with React, you definitely need to know about this!

2. Optimizing React/Redux Performance

    React tries to be fast by default, and for most cases it is. It can be easy to be fast with React, but it’s also just as easy to be slow. I’ll be going over some common pitfalls and how to identify performance issues.  Sometimes it can be difficult to optimize some forms of normalized data; like nested tree structures. I will demonstrate a way to use generators reduce the tree-walking necessary on each render.

## What
A meetup where we discuss all things javascript, but mainly focusing on React and associated members of the React ecosystem.  We're very conversational in format, and always have food and drinks available for attendees!

## When
We usually meet on the last Wednesday of every month at 6pm.  If there are sports events that conflict, it might be another day of the week occasionally.

## Where
#### Local
Benzinga Global Headquarters
1 Campus Martius #200, Detroit, MI 48226
#### Remote
[YouTube Live](https://youtube.com/channel/UC5nH9vHH4512vDhxnvk3kPA/live)

## Why
Detroit is growing fast, that much is for sure.  We started this meetup to address an equally growing growing need for resource groups and engineer networks aimed at frontend technologies (and where better to start than with React).

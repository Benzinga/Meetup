# Detroit React Developers Meetup
## Schedule for the next meetup (July 26th)
1. ES2017 (ES8): What you need to know
2. TBD

## What
A meetup where we discuss all things javascript, but mainly focusing on React and associated members of the React ecosystem.  We're very conversational in format, and always have food and drinks available for attendees!

## When
We meet on the last Wednesday of every month at 6pm.  It's been on Wendesdays since before Rick and Morty season 3 was announced to be on Wednesdays, so we may adjust accordingly depending on what the airtime looks like.

## Where
#### Local
Benzinga Global Headquarters
1 Campus Martius #200, Detroit, MI 48226
#### Remote

## Why
Detroit is growing fast, that much is for sure.  We started this meetup to address an equally growing growing need for resource groups and engineer networks aimed at frontend technologies (and where better to start than with React).
